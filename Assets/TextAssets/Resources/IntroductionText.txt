Finally. The first steps are done. I came here to Germany to study, but I still have a lot of bureaucratic work ahead of me. Apparently, they want me to register my apartment and get a residence permit. My first appointment is today, and I've prepared all the documents they want to see at the city office. Well almost, the main form I still need to print. But the rest should be here in my room somewhere, I just need to put everything in my bag before I go.

I already have my visa and passport. What else is there? Maybe I should check my notes...
