This was a great success. Sure, my knees are heavy and my palms are sweaty. But I got what I came for: the Registration of Residence.
I will celebrate this with something I brought from home: mom's spaghetti!

--- A few months later. ---
Okay! My next appointment at the office will be for the residence permit.
I'll have to gather all the necessary documents before I go there.
Some of those I will have to print out from my computer. And others I will receive by (snail) mail.
